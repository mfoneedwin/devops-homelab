# DevOps Home Lab – Production CI/CD Platform

## 📌 Overview
Production-ready DevOps platform demonstrating CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, containerization, Kubernetes, and monitoring.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

I built this DevOps home lab to demonstrate practical, production-aligned experience with:
- CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions)
- Containerization (Docker)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Kubernetes deployment patterns
- Monitoring and alerting (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Secure web delivery (Nginx + HTTPS)

The focus is on repeatable automation, debugging, and real operational workflows rather than one-off tutorials.


## 🧱 Architecture
